# Classroom Digital Twins with Instrumentation-Free Gaze Tracking

## How to run

To run the visualizer, just run the local server at the root folder. Simplest way to do this is to run the following command and then go to localhost:8080 in the web browser. 

```sh
python -m http.server 8080
```

The code for 6 DOF gaze tracking is also integrated in the [EduSense Repo](https://github.com/edusense/edusense).
